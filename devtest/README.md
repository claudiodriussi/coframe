# Coframe Testing and Flask Server

Under the `devtest` directory you will find useful scripts written to test
Coframe library.

## Testing

The `devtest.py` script, starts Coframe and if needed regenerate the source
code for `model.py` and the database `devtest.sqlite`.

The perform some tests on the coframe system.

### Usage

```bash
python devtest.py
```

## Flask Server

The `flask-server.py` script provides a Flask-based API server for interacting
with Coframe.

Please read the main README.md file.

### Features

- RESTful API for Coframe functionality
- Authentication with JWT tokens
- CRUD operations for all database models
- Dynamic query builder support

### Setup and Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required dependencies (see requirements.txt)

#### Installation

Read the main README.md file.

#### Configuration

The server is configured via `config.yaml`. Key sections include:

- Basic application info (name, version, etc.)
- Database connection settings
- Authentication configuration

### Usage

#### Starting the Server

```bash
python flask_server.py
```

The server will start on port 5000 by default.

### API Endpoints

#### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate with username and password

#### Database Operations

- `GET /api/db/<table>`: Get all records from a table
- `GET /api/db/<table>/<id>`: Get a single record by ID
- `POST /api/db/<table>`: Create a new record
- `PUT /api/db/<table>/<id>`: Update a record
- `DELETE /api/db/<table>/<id>`: Delete a record

#### Query Builder

- `POST /api/query`: Execute a dynamic query

#### Generic Endpoint

- `POST /api/endpoint/<operation>`: Call any Coframe operation
readmet user profile
- `GET /api/users/me`: Alias for profile

#### Testing with Jupyter Notebook

The included Jupyter notebook (`server-test.ipynb`) demonstrates how to interact with the API. It covers:

1. Authentication and token management
2. Basic CRUD operations
3. Advanced queries with the query builder
4. Using the generic endpoint
5. Error handling
6. Batch operations
7. Filtering and aggregations
8. Working with relationships

### Extending the Server

#### Adding New Endpoints

To add a new endpoint, update the Flask server (`flask_server.py`) with your new route.

#### Adding Coframe Endpoints

To add new Coframe endpoints, create a Python file with the `@endpoint` decorator and place it in your plugins directory.
